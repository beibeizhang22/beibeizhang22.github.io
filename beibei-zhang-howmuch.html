    <h1>How Much Should You Borrow?</h1>
    <p>Determining how much you should borrow for a mortgage is a crucial financial decision. Borrowing too much can strain your finances, while borrowing too little might limit your housing options. Here are key factors to consider.</p>

    <h2 id="factors">Factors to Consider</h2>
    <h3>1. Income and Debt</h3>
    <p>Your income and existing debts play a major role in deciding how much you can afford. Lenders use the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to evaluate your borrowing capacity.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Monthly Budget</h3>
    <p>Consider how much you can comfortably afford to pay each month, factoring in not just your mortgage, but also utilities, insurance, and maintenance costs.</p>

    <h3>3. Down Payment</h3>
    <p>The size of your down payment affects how much you need to borrow. A larger down payment reduces the loan amount and may lower your interest rate.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Loan Term and Interest Rates</h3>
    <p>Shorter loan terms have higher monthly payments but lower total interest costs. Longer terms have lower monthly payments but more interest over time.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Emergency Savings</h3>
    <p>Ensure you have enough savings for emergencies. Borrowing the maximum amount may leave little financial cushion for unexpected expenses.</p>
    
    <h2 id="guidelines">General Borrowing Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the <strong>28/36 rule</strong>: Spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing and 36% on total debt payments.</li>
        <li>Aim for a <strong>loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</strong> of 80% or lower to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).</li>
        <li>Use mortgage calculators to estimate affordability before committing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Borrowing responsibly ensures long-term financial stability. Assess your financial situation, set a realistic budget, and choose a mortgage that aligns with your goals.</p>
