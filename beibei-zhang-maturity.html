    <h1>15-Year vs. 30-Year Mortgages</h1>
    <p>When choosing a mortgage, you typically have two common term options: <strong>15-year</strong> and <strong>30-year</strong>. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your financial goals and situation.</p>

    <h2>15-Year Mortgage</h2>
    <h3>What is a 15-Year Mortgage?</h3>
    <p>A 15-year mortgage is a home loan that is fully paid off in 15 years, featuring higher monthly payments but lower interest costs.</p>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Total Interest Costs</strong> – You pay significantly less interest over the life of the loan.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Equity Building</strong> – Your home equity grows more quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Interest Rates</strong> – Lenders typically offer lower interest rates compared to 30-year loans.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Monthly Payments</strong> – Payments are higher due to the shorter loan term.</li>
        <li><strong>Less Budget Flexibility</strong> – You may have less disposable income for other investments or expenses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>30-Year Mortgage</h2>
    <h3>What is a 30-Year Mortgage?</h3>
    <p>A 30-year mortgage is a home loan paid off over 30 years, with lower monthly payments but higher total interest costs.</p>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Monthly Payments</strong> – More affordable payments allow for better cash flow.</li>
        <li><strong>More Budget Flexibility</strong> – You can use extra funds for other investments or expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Easier Qualification</strong> – Lower payments may make it easier to qualify for a mortgage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Total Interest Costs</strong> – You pay more interest over the life of the loan.</li>
        <li><strong>Slower Equity Growth</strong> – It takes longer to build home equity.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Interest Rates</strong> – Lenders often charge higher interest rates compared to 15-year loans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which One is Right for You?</h2>
    <p>- Choose a <strong>15-Year Mortgage</strong> if you want to pay off your home faster and save on interest.</p>
    <p>- Choose a <strong>30-Year Mortgage</strong> if you prefer lower monthly payments and greater financial flexibility.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage depends on your financial situation and long-term goals. Consider your budget, interest rates, and future plans before making a decision.</p>
