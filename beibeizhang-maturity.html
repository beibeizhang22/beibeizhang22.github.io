    <h1>15-Year vs. 30-Year Mortgages</h1>
    <p>When choosing a mortgage, you typically have two common term options: <strong>15-year</strong> and <strong>30-year</strong>. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your financial goals and situation.</p>

    <h2>15-Year Mortgage</h2>
    <h3>What is a 15-Year Mortgage?</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>30-Year Mortgage</h2>
    <h3>What is a 30-Year Mortgage?</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>Which One is Right for You?</h2>
    <p>- Choose a <strong>15-Year Mortgage</strong> if you want to pay off your home faster and save on interest.</p>
    <p>- Choose a <strong>30-Year Mortgage</strong> if you prefer lower monthly payments and greater financial flexibility.</p>
