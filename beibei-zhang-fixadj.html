    <h1>Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages</h1>
    <p>When choosing a mortgage, one of the biggest decisions you'll face is whether to opt for a <strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgage (FRM)</strong> or an <strong>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</strong>. Each has its own benefits and potential drawbacks, depending on your financial situation and market conditions.</p>

    <h2>Fixed-Rate Mortgage (FRM)</h2>
    <h3>What is a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?</h3>
    <p>A fixed-rate mortgage maintains the <strong>same interest rate</strong> throughout the entire loan term, meaning your monthly payments remain consistent.</p>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predictable Payments</strong> – Monthly payments remain the same, making budgeting easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection from Rate Hikes</strong> – You won’t be affected by rising interest rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Stability</strong> – Ideal for those planning to stay in their home for many years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Initial Interest Rate</strong> – Compared to ARMs, fixed-rate mortgages often start with higher rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Less Flexibility</strong> – If interest rates drop, refinancing may be needed to get a lower rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h2>
    <h3>What is an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage?</h3>
    <p>An ARM starts with a <strong>lower introductory interest rate</strong>, which later adjusts periodically based on market conditions.</p>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Initial Rates</strong> – Often more affordable in the first few years compared to fixed-rate mortgages.</li>
        <li><strong>Good for Short-Term Homeowners</strong> – If you plan to move before the adjustment period, you can benefit from lower initial payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential for Lower Costs</strong> – If interest rates decrease, your payments could go down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpredictable Payments</strong> – Monthly payments can increase after the fixed period.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Long-Term Risk</strong> – If interest rates rise significantly, your mortgage could become much more expensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Terms</strong> – ARMs come with different adjustment periods, caps, and index rates that can be confusing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which One is Right for You?</h2>
    <p>- Choose a <strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgage</strong> if you want stability and plan to stay in your home long-term.</p>
    <p>- Choose an <strong>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</strong> if you plan to move within a few years or believe interest rates will remain low.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Understanding your financial situation and market trends is crucial when choosing between a fixed or adjustable-rate mortgage. Consulting a mortgage professional can help you make the best decision for your needs.</p>
